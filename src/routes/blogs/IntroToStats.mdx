##### **Basics of R and RStudio**

###### Installation of R and RStudio

Before we can start, you will need to download R and RStudio onto your computer.

You can download R through this link [R Download Link](https://cran.ms.unimelb.edu.au/)

And download RStudio through this link [RStudio Download Link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

*At the current time, We aren't able to run the code on this website, so please run it and follow along on your computer*

###### Variables and Calculations in R

Like most coding languages, R can store values in variables, to do so, use the assignment operator below.

You can also do calculations with numbers in R, navigate to the console and try these. 

```R
x <- 5 * 12

y <- 16 / sqrt(4 * 16)

z < x + y
```
R will store these values and you can use them later. 

###### Defining Functions in R
We can also define functions in R, the following is a basic function to subtract two numbers. 

Note you can also use the variables from before as the inputs. 
```R
subtract_numbers <- function(a, b) {
    result <- a - b
    return(result)
}
```
###### Vectors (Lists in R)

R can create vectors, which is a list of values of the same type, you can also access these values with indexing. 

*Note that R's index starts at 1 instead of 0.* 

```R
names <- c("John", "Max", "Sonia")

accuracy <- c(80, 20, 30)
```
Here ```accuracy[1]``` here would output 80. 

##### **Descriptive Statistics**

One of R's strengths is its ability to describe and visualise datasets. It has various inbuilt functions that help us do this.

The following section will explore descriptive statistics using the pre-loaded Iris dataset:

Before we continue, please run the following code. 

We will also need to download and load the lsr package. We will go over the installation of packages in a later tutorial.

```R
install.packages("lsr")
```

```R
library(lsr)
data(iris)
head(iris)
```
###### Dataset Wrangling

Before we can start visualise and describe data, we need to be able to access the correct rows and columns. 

To access specific columns we can use the \$ operator.

For example:

```R
iris$Petal.Length # To get the petal lengths vector

iris$Petal.Length[1] # To get the petal length of the first flower

iris$Species # To get the species names vector
```

### PHOTO 


If we want to, we can also alter the data individually or we can alter the entire vector as a whole.

For example:

```R
iris$Petal.Length <- iris$Petal.Length + 10 
```
```R
iris$Petal.Length
```
```R
iris$Petal.Length[1] <- iris$Petal.Length[1] - 100
```
```R
iris$Petal.Length[1]
```

Remember to alter your data back to as it was before.

```R
iris$Petal.Length[1] <- iris$Petal.Length[1] + 100
```
```R
iris$Petal.Length <- iris$Petal.Length - 10 
```
```R
iris$Petal.Length
```

We can also add columns to the table if we want to.  

The following code will create a column with trues which satisfies the condition. 

```R
iris$long.petal <- iris$Petal.Length > 5 
```

```R 
iris$long.petal
```

And we can remove columns with the following code.

```R
iris$long.petal <- NULL
```

```R
head(iris)
```

#### Measures of Central Tendency

Whilst manipulating datasets is a great tool, it is pretty hard to visualise the data well.

Often, in communication, it is useful to describe a dataset with a single value. 

Statisticians have developed measures of central tendency and spread to describe datasets.

There are three main measures of central tendency.
<Grid container spacing={3} className="mt-4">
  <Grid item xs={12} sm={4}>
    <Paper className="p-6" style={{ backgroundColor: '#000', color: '#fff', height: '100%' }}>
      <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>Mean</Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        The mean is the average of the dataset. 
      </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        It is found by adding up all the observations and then dividing by the total number of observations.
      </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        It is the most common measure of central tendency.
      </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        In R, you can calculate it using:
      </Typography>
      <Typography component="pre" style={{ backgroundColor: '#333', padding: '8px', borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'auto' }}>
        {`mean(iris$Sepal.Length)`}
      </Typography>
    </Paper>
  </Grid>

  <Grid item xs={12} sm={4}>
    <Paper className="p-6" style={{ backgroundColor: '#000', color: '#fff', height: '100%' }}>
      <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>Median</Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        The median is the middle observation when the data is sorted.
      </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        Half of the observations are greater than the median and half are smaller.
      </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        It is typically used when there are outliers in the dataset that skew the mean.
      </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        In R, you can calculate it using:
      </Typography>
      <Typography component="pre" style={{ backgroundColor: '#333', padding: '8px', borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'auto' }}>
        {`median(iris$Sepal.Length)`}
      </Typography>
    </Paper>
  </Grid>

  <Grid item xs={12} sm={4}>
    <Paper className="p-6" style={{ backgroundColor: '#000', color: '#fff', height: '100%' }}>
      <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>Mode</Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        The mode is the most common observation in the dataset.
      </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        It is often used in nominal or ordinal data.
      </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        In R, you can calculate it using the ModeOf function from the <i>lsr</i> package:
      </Typography>
      <Typography component="pre" style={{ backgroundColor: '#333', padding: '8px', borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'auto' }}>
        {`modeOf(iris$Sepal.Length)`}
      </Typography>
    </Paper>
  </Grid>
</Grid>

#### Measures of Spread

Whilst measures of central tendency are extremely useful as a stand alone value, often, 

Statisticians want to understand the distribution of the data. 

Measures of spread are cruical when explaining how much the data varies. 

There are three main measures of spread in statistics. 

<Grid container spacing={3} className="mt-4">
  <Grid item xs={12} sm={4}>
    <Paper className="p-6" style={{ backgroundColor: '#000', color: '#fff', height: '100%' }}>
      <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>Range</Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        The range is found by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value.
      </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        In R, there is a built-in function that returns both the minimum and maximum values.
      </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        You can calculate the range in R using:
      </Typography>
      <Typography component="pre" style={{ backgroundColor: '#333', padding: '8px', borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'auto' }}>
        {`range(iris$Sepal.Length)`}
      </Typography>
    </Paper>
  </Grid>

  <Grid item xs={12} sm={4}>
    <Paper className="p-6" style={{ backgroundColor: '#000', color: '#fff', height: '100%' }}>
      <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>Interquartile Range (IQR)</Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        The interquartile range represents the middle 50% of the data, from the 25th to the 75th percentile.
      </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        It can be calculated with the IQR function and is often visualized with a boxplot.
      </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        In R, you can calculate the IQR and visualize it using:
      </Typography>
      <Typography component="pre" style={{ backgroundColor: '#333', padding: '8px', borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'auto' }}>
        {`IQR(iris$Sepal.Length)`}
      </Typography>
    </Paper>
  </Grid>

  <Grid item xs={12} sm={4}>
    <Paper className="p-6" style={{ backgroundColor: '#000', color: '#fff', height: '100%' }}>
      <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>Standard Deviation</Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        The standard deviation is the most common measure of spread.
      </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        It measures how far each point is from the mean.
      </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        About 95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations from the mean.
      </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        It is also the square root of the variance.
      </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
        In R, you can calculate it using:
      </Typography>
      <Typography component="pre" style={{ backgroundColor: '#333', padding: '8px', borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'auto' }}>
        {`sd(iris$Sepal.Length)`}
      </Typography>
    </Paper>
  </Grid>
</Grid>

##### Graphing with Histograms

###### Histograms

To visualise the sepal lengths for the dataset we can use the following code.

Note that we are using sepal length now

```R
hist(iris$Sepal.Length)
```
<img src={hist} alt="Histogram" style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }} />

###### Customized Histogram

We can customize the functions to make the graphs clearer. 

These are just some of the popular arguments, but there are many more to explore. 

```R
hist(iris$Sepal.Length, col = "blue", 
     xlab = "Length of Sepal", main = "Frequency Table of Sepal Lengths")
```

<img src={cust_hist} alt="Customised Histogram" style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }} />

These are just some of the many plots R can produce. You can check the documentation for more examples.

*Note that if you have missing values in your dataset, you will have to remove them with the argument na.rm = True.*

###### The Summary Function:

In this tutorial we have learnt how to find measures of both central tendency and spread to get a feel for the data. 

Whilst we have done this using the pre-built functions, we can use the summary function instead.

```R
summary(iris$Sepal.Length)
```
