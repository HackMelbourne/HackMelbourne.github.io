### Git Tutorial

Note that this assumes you have python and a code editor (Eg. vscode downloaded), and a github account.

#### What are Version Control Systems?

Before we talk about Git, we need to talk about Version Control Systems (VCS).

They enable developers to work simultaneously on the same project, experiment with new ideas, and easily revert to previous versions if needed.

They are much more efficient than just sending code back and forth between developers and are essential in the Computer Science World.

#### Centralized vs Distributed

There are two main types of VCS, centralized and distributed.

##### Centralized VCS:

-   In a centralized VCS, there's a single, central server that stores all versions of files.

-   Developers must continuously sync their work with this central server.

-   These are pretty useful however if the central server goes down, then no one will be able to work on the project.

##### Distributed VCS:

-   In a distributed VCS, each developer has their own local repository, containing the complete project history.

-   Developers can work independently, with the ability to commit changes locally without immediately affecting the central (main) repository.

-   They can then sync their changes manually with other repositories as needed.

#### Why is Git important?

Git is a distributed VCS.
It's a massively popular tool for managing projects among individuals and teams.

Knowing how to use Git is an extremely important skill for any developer - and it will look great on your resume!

#### Downloading Git

First you will need to download Git onto your computer... You can do so through this [Git Download Link](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

After installing it, start your terminal and type the following command to verify that Git is installed on your computer.

```bash         
git --version
```

If everything went well, it should return the Git version that is installed on your computer.

#### Configuring Git

After installing Git onto your computer, you will need to configure it with your name and email address

```bash         
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

Replace "Your Name" with your name and "your_email@example.com" with your email address.
This information is included in the commit metadata and helps identify who made a particular change in your project.
(Note this is done globally, so it will apply to all your repositories)

If you want to change your name within a repository (so they wont affect any other ones), you can use the following commands to set them, unset it, and also reconfigure them:

```bash         
git config <key> <value>

git config --unset <key>

git config --unset-all <key>
```

Where key is user.name or user.email.
Note that --unset all is an option if you have multiple configurations.

If you want to unset your global configurations, you can use the following:

```bash         
git config --global --unset <key>
```

#### Initializing a Git Repository

To start version controlling your project, navigate to your project's working directory (folder) using the terminal and run:

```bash         
git init
```

This creates a new Git repository in your project directory.

Make sure you are in the directory (folder) that you are planning to work in for the whole project.

#### Adding files to your Repository

To add files to the staging area (the area where changes to files are prepared before they are committed), you can use:

```bash         
git add filename
```

Or if you want to add all of them at once, you can use:

```bash         
git add .
```

#### Committing a change to the repository

Once you have added the files, you need to commit them to "save them',

```bash         
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

Your message should be a brief description of the changes you have made to the project since the last commit.

#### Differences between Adding files and Committing changes

When you are working on projects, there are three main areas that changes go through.
There is the working directory (where you are actually coding), the staging area (where you prepare your changes in the next commit) and the Git Repository (where you save your changes locally).

**Working Directory to Staging Area:** Use **`git add`** to move changes from your working directory to the staging area, where you prepare what you want to include in the next commit.

**Staging Area to Git Repository:** Once you've finalized your changes in the staging area, use **`git commit`** to save those changes as a commit in the Git repository.
This will create a snapshot of your work in the Git history which you can go back to if you ever want to.

See the diagram below:

#### Branches

Branches in Git allow you to work on different features or bug fixes without affecting the main code-base.
To create a new branch, you can use:

```bash         
git branch new_branchname
```

Great, you have created a new branch, however you need to switch to that branch before you make any changes... to do so, use:

```bash         
git checkout new_branchname
```

Now you can start experimenting with your code without affecting your main code-base :

#### Cloning a repository

Cloning creates a local copy of a remote repository on your machine.
This allows you to work on the project, make changes (without affecting the remote repository).

Before you get started, ensure that you are in the working directory that you want to clone the online repository to.

To get the repository_url,

1.  Navigate to the repository you want to clone
2.  Click the code button...
3.  Copy the URL for the repository.

and then you have it, now to clone a repository you can use:

```bash         
git clone repository_url
```

#### Forking a Repository

Forking involves creating a copy of a repository on your GitHub account.
Note this is different to cloning as the copy is on your GitHub account rather than your local repository.
This allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original repository.

Here's how you can fork a repository:

1\.
Visit the Repository: Go to the repository you want to fork on GitHub.

2\.
Fork: Click on the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the repository page.

Great you have forked the repository (made a copy) onto your account, now you need to clone it so you can make changes locally.
To do so,

1\.
Navigate to the forked repository on your github account,

2\.
Click the code button...

3\.
Copy the URL for the repository.

4\.
Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of YOUR-USERNAME

Eg.

```bash         
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/repository_name
```

#### Pushing changes to a Remote repository

So far you have been working locally and haven't made your changes accessible to others.
To make your changes available, you need to push them to a remote repository.

Note you will have to get the link of the repository you want to push the changes to before you do this.

To push your changes, use:

```bash         
git remote add origin remote_repository_url 
```

And then, do:

```bash         
git push -u origin branchname
```

Where branchname is the branch you want to push to and origin is the name of remote repository name.

Note that if you want to push to the main branch you would make branchname main or master depending on what it is called on the Github website.
And you might need to do a pull request beforehand.
For more information, please head to Github website.

#### Checking Status / logs in Git

Git has a command to check the status of your files, you can do so with the following:

```bash         
git status
```

This will show you which files are modified, which files are staged for commit, and which files are untracked.

If you want to check the a list of the commits that have been used, you can use:

```bash         
git log
```
