# Typescript

## Introduction

Welcome to my first tech blog post! In this post, I'll be discussing the importance of using TypeScript in your JavaScript projects.

## Why TypeScript?

### 1. Type Safety

TypeScript provides static typing, which helps catch errors during development. This leads to more robust and reliable code.

### 2. Improved Code Quality

With TypeScript's type system, developers can write more descriptive code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

### 3. Better Tooling Support

TypeScript integrates seamlessly with popular editors and IDEs, providing features like autocompletion, refactoring tools, and better documentation.

## Getting Started with TypeScript

To get started with TypeScript, you can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install typescript
```

<h1 className="h-100px w-100px">H1 Tag</h1>
