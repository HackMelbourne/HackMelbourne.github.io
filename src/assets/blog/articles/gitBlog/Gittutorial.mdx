##### **What are Version Control Systems?**

Before we talk about Git, we need to talk about Version Control Systems (VCS). <br/><br/>

They enable developers to work simultaneously on the same project, experiment with new ideas, and easily revert to previous versions if needed. <br/><br/>

They are much more efficient than just sending code back and forth between developers and are essential in the Computer Science World. <br/><br/>

##### **Centralized vs Distributed**

There are two main types of VCS, centralized and distributed. <br/><br/>

    <Paper className="p-4" style={{ backgroundColor: '#000', color: '#fff' }}>
      <Typography variant="h6">Centralized VCS</Typography>
      <Typography>1. There's a single, central server that stores all versions of files.</Typography>
      <Typography>2. Developers must continuously sync their work with this central server.</Typography>
      <Typography>3. If the central server goes down, then no one will be able to work on the project.</Typography>
    </Paper>
  </Grid>
  <Grid item xs={12} sm={6}>
    <Paper className="p-4" style={{ backgroundColor: '#000', color: '#fff' }}>
      <Typography variant="h6">Distributed VCS</Typography>
      <Typography>1. Each developer has their own local repository, containing the complete project history.</Typography>
      <Typography>2. Developers can work independently and commit changes locally without affecting the main repository.</Typography>
      <Typography>3. They can then sync their changes manually with other repositories as needed.</Typography>
    </Paper>
  </Grid>
</Grid>

##### **Why is Git important?** <br/>

Git is a distributed VCS. <br/><br/>
It's a massively popular tool for managing projects among individuals and teams. <br/><br/>

Knowing how to use Git is an extremely important skill for any developer - and it will look great on your resume! <br/><br/>

##### **Downloading Git**

First you will need to download Git onto your computer... You can do so through this [Git Download Link](https://git-scm.com/downloads) <br/><br/>

After installing it, start your terminal and type the following command to verify that Git is installed on your computer.
```bash       

git --version

```
If everything went well, it should return the Git version that is installed on your computer. <br/><br/>

##### **Configuring Git** 

After installing Git onto your computer, you will need to configure it with your name and email address

```bash         

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"

```

This information is included in the commit metadata and helps identify who made a particular change in your project.<br/><br/>

(Note this is done globally, so it will apply to all your repositories) <br/><br/>

If you want to change your name within a repository (so they wont affect any other ones), 

You can use the following commands to set them, unset it, and also reconfigure them:

```bash      

git config <key> <value>

git config --unset <key>

git config --unset-all <key>

```

*Where key is **user.name** or **user.email**.*

Note that --unset all is an option if you have multiple configurations. <br/><br/>

If you want to unset your global configurations, you can use the following:

```bash         

git config --global --unset <key>

```

##### **Initializing a Git Repository**

To start version controlling your project, navigate to your project's working directory (folder) using the terminal and run:

```bash   

git init

```

This creates a new Git repository in your project directory. <br/><br/>

Make sure you are in the directory (folder) that you are planning to work in for the whole project. <br/><br/>

##### **Adding files to your Repository**

To add files to the staging area (the area where changes to files are prepared before they are committed), you can use:

```bash  

git add filename

```

Or if you want to add all of them at once, you can use:

```bash    

git add .

```

##### **Committing a change to the repository**

Once you have added the files, you need to commit them to "save them',

```bash      

git commit -m "Your commit message here"

```

Your message should be a brief description of the changes you have made to the project since the last commit. <br/><br/>

##### **Differences between Adding files and Committing changes**

When you are working on projects, there are three main areas that changes go through. <br/><br/>

There is the **Working Directory** (where you are actually coding), the **Staging Area** (where you prepare your changes in the next commit) and the **Git Repository** (where you save your changes locally). <br/><br/>

- **Working Directory to Staging Area:** Use **`git add`** to move changes from your working directory to the staging area, where you prepare what you want to include in the next commit. <br/><br/>

- **Staging Area to Git Repository:** Once you've finalized your changes in the staging area, use **`git commit`** to save those changes as a commit in the Git repository. <br/><br/>

Committing will create a snapshot of your work in the Git log which you can go back to if you ever want to. <br/><br/> 
Please see the diagram below: <br/><br/>

##### **Branches**

Branches in Git allow you to work on different features or bug fixes without affecting the main code-base.<br/><br/>

To create a new branch, you can use:

```bash   

git branch new_branchname

```

*Great, you have created a new branch,*

*However you need to switch to that branch before you make any changes... to do so, use:*

```bash         

git checkout new_branchname

```

Now you can start experimenting with your code without affecting your main code-base :<br/><br/>

##### **Cloning a repository**

Cloning creates a local copy of a remote repository on your machine.

This allows you to work on the project, make changes (without affecting the remote repository).<br/><br/>

Before you get started, ensure that you are in the working directory that you want to clone the online repository to.

To get the repository_url: <br/><br/>

1\. Navigate to the repository you want to clone<br/><br/>
2\. Click the code button...<br/><br/>
3\. Copy the URL for the repository.<br/><br/>

And then you have it, now to clone a repository you can use:

```bash         

git clone repository_url

```

##### **Forking a Repository**

Forking involves creating a copy of a repository on your GitHub account. <br/><br/>

Note this is different to cloning as the copy is on your GitHub account rather than your local repository. <br/><br/>

This allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original repository. <br/><br/>

Here's how you can fork a repository:

1. **Visit the Repository:**  
   Go to the repository you want to fork on GitHub.

2. **Fork:**  
   Click on the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the repository page.

   *Great! You have forked the repository (made a copy) onto your account. Now you need to clone it so you can make changes locally. To do so:*

   1. **Navigate to the Forked Repository:**  
      Go to the forked repository on your GitHub account.

   2. **Click the "Code" Button:**  
      Click the green "Code" button located above the list of files.

   3. **Copy the Repository URL:**  
      In the dropdown, ensure you're on the "HTTPS" tab and click the clipboard icon to copy the URL.

   4. **Clone the Repository Locally:**  
      Open your terminal and type `git clone`, then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of `YOUR-USERNAME`
```bash     
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/repository_name

```

##### **Pushing changes to a Remote repository**

So far you have been working locally and haven't made your changes accessible to others. <br/><br/>

To make your changes available, you need to push them to a remote repository. <br/><br/>

Note you will have to get the link of the repository you want to push the changes to before you do this. <br/><br/>

To push your changes, use:

```bash       

git remote add origin remote_repository_url 

```

And then, do:

```bash         

git push -u origin branchname

```

Where branchname is the branch you want to push to and origin is the name of remote repository name. <br/><br/>

##### **Checking Status / logs in Git**

Git has a command to check the status of your files, you can do so with the following:

```bash         

git status

```

This will show you which files are modified, which files are staged for commit, and which files are untracked.<br/><br/>

If you want to check the a list of the commits that have been used, you can use:

```bash    

git log

```
